# Twingate Zero Trust Security Network Setup

## Overview
In this project, I demonstrate the setup of a Zero Trust Security Network using Twingate. This setup connects devices like a laptop, mobile, and iPad to AWS, ensuring secure and continuous verification of access.

## Why Zero Trust?
Zero Trust Networks continuously verify every access request, ensuring a higher level of security than traditional VPNs. With Twingate, I can seamlessly secure connections across multiple devices.

## Tools Used:
- **Twingate** for Zero Trust Network setup
- **AWS** as the cloud infrastructure
- **macOS, iPadOS, iOS/Android** for device integration

## Steps to Set Up Twingate

### 1. Setting Up Twingate on a Laptop
1. Sign up for a Twingate account at [Twingate](https://www.twingate.com).
2. Create a new network and configure resources (e.g., AWS EC2 instances).
3. Download the Twingate client for your laptop (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
4. Install and sign in with your credentials.
5. Follow the setup wizard to connect your laptop to the Zero Trust Network.
